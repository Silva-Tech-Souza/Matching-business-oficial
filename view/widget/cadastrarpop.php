                        Dear user,<br>

                        Your account is linked to a Legal Entity (PJ). Each PJ account can have up to 5 users. This restriction aims to ensure security and proper control of the company's activities. <br>

                        The difference between verified and unverified accounts is simple: verified accounts submit the required documentation to prove their legitimacy, gaining benefits such as increased trust, access to advanced features, and priority support. Unverified accounts have some limitations and may not have full access to all features. <br>

                        To make the most of our platform, we recommend verifying your PJ account and enjoying all available benefits.<br>

                        If you have any questions, our support team is ready to assist.<br>

                        Best regards,
                    </p>
